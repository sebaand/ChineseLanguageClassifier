Why is it bandaged up?小刘：Don’t get me started! I have been so unlucky recently. At the weekend I was taking the children out to the suburbs for fun, the weather was too cold and the road so icy. I walked and fell. My eyes and nose were bleeding.小陈：This really is bad luck. Did you go the dospital? Is it serious?小刘：Just a flesh wound, but it is not easy to recover in winter, you need to apply gauze. It is really important to be careful when going out in winter.小陈：Yes, the roads in winter freeze very easily. Whether you are driving or cycling, you should pay attention to safety.1 – 小陈怎么会摔倒呢？2 – 小陈伤的严重吗？Review frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
