    "text": "Today’s intermediate reading article is describing a game called “Whisper”.Pay attention to the use of the verb 转给 which takes the meaning of “to pass on”今天我和朋友们玩了一个有趣的游戏，叫做悄悄话。一个朋友站在队伍前面监督。第二个朋友会把一句话悄悄地传给下一位朋友，只能嘴动，不能出声音。然后听到的朋友再传给别人。直到最后一个朋友，大声告诉大家，他听到了什么。我们特别喜欢这个游戏，因为最初传递的话，到最后都变成了别的意思。真是有趣。Today I played a fun game with my friends, It is called “whisper”. A friend stands in front of the team to supervise. The second friend quietly passes a sentence to the next friend, they can move their mouth but must not make a sound. Then the message is passed on to the next person until it reaches the last person. They must tell everyone loudly what they heard.We especially like this game, because the words that were originally delivered turned into something else at the end. It’s really fun.1 – 游戏叫什么？a. 稍稍话b. 悄悄话c. 别说话d. 捉迷藏1. bReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
