    "text": "This is a slightly strange article describing 3 animals in a picture.Note how the measure word for animals is 只 for the monkey and bear, but 头 for the pig.今天我看到一副很有趣的图片，图片当中有三只动物在运木头。一只猴子，一只灰熊和一头猪。猴子把木头放在水里让木头乘着水流流动，手里牵着拴到木头的绳子。强壮的灰熊把木头高高地举起来。小猪用腿踢着木头向前挪动。你觉得哪一个动物的方式更加聪明呢？Today I saw a very amusing picture of three animals moving a log. A monkey, a grizzly bear and a pig.The monkey put the log in the water and let the log flow with the water, grasping a rope that was fastened to the log.The strong grizzly bear lifted the log high.The pig kicked the log forward with his legs.Which animal do you think is smarter?1 – 哪一只动物用绳子？a. 猪b. 猴子c. 灰熊1. bReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
