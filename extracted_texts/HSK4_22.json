    "text": "WeChat is a popular messaging app in China. It allows you to send stickers to people: they are gifs that are used to convey emotions and feelings.我特别喜欢微信的聊天表情，因为它们形象生动地表达了自己想要表达的内容。而且让对话充满了趣味。有些内容比较抽象，或者想要隐晦的表达出来，表情包就变得十分有用了。我最喜欢的是动画系列的，比如小动物：可爱的小猫，小狗。微信表情包借助这些动物的眼神动作，就把我要说的话用好玩的方式说出来了！I really like WeChat’s stickers because they vividly express what I want to convey, and they make the conversation full of fun. For some content that is more abstract, or that you want to express implicitly, stickers become very useful. My favorite is the animated series, such as “small animals”: cute kittens and puppies.With the expressive eyes of these animals, the WeChat stickers say what I want to say in a fun way!1 – 根据文章，我喜欢用微信聊天表情包的原因不包括？a. 生动形象表达内容c. 微信表情包特别可爱d. 把想说的话以好玩方式说出来Review frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
