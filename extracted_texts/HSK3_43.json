    "text": "A Chinese dialogue discussing household chores (家务).王女士：李姐，你喜欢做家务吗？李女士：不喜欢，我特别讨厌做家务，尤其是刷碗，你呢？王女士：我也不喜欢做家务，尤其不喜欢洗衣服。可是家里有很多的衣服需要洗。每天都好累！李女士：你可以放在洗衣机里，然后就不管它了。王女士：是呢，但是担心洗衣机洗的不干净。孩子还有很多的玩具，需要收拾。李女士：我觉得你应该教育孩子，自己的事情自己做，玩儿完玩具以后，要自己放到原来的储物篮里。王女士：你说的太对了，我下次一定这样做！王女士：Do you like to do chores?李女士：No I don’t, I hate doing chores especially washing up. You?王女士：I don’t like to do chores either, especially washing clothes. But my family always has so many clothes that need washing. I’m tired every day.李女士：You can put them in a washing machine, then you don’t need to worry about it.王女士：Yes, but I am afraid the washing machine won’t clean them well. My children have lots of toys that require putting away.李女士：I think you should educate your children that they should take care of their own business. After they are finished playing, they should put them back into the storage box.王女士：You’re right. I will do this next time!1 – 王女士特别不喜欢什么家务？a. 洗盘子b. 铺床c. 洗地板d. 洗衣服2 – 孩子们应该把玩具放在哪里？a. 在车里b. 在储物篮里c. 在抽屉里d. 在床上1. d2. bReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
