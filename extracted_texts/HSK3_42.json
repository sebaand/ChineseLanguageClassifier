    "text": "A Chinese passage about going to a convenience store.我很喜欢逛杂货店，因为在那里可以找到很多自己想要买的物品，而且还不贵。我家楼下就有一个杂货店，在那里我可以买到厨房用品，清洁用品等等，特别方便！有时候，还可以看到之前自己没有用过的物品，比如，有一次我去逛杂货店，发现了一种新的拖布，特别小，不占空间，而且很容易弄干，简直太棒了！I really like to shop at the general store because I can find the products I want and they are not expensive.There is a grocery store underneath my home, I can buy kitchen products, cleaning products etc… it is all very convenient!Sometimes I can find items that I have never used before. For example, I once found a new type of mop, it was very small, it didn’t take up much space and was very easy to dry. Simply marvellous!1 – 她家的楼下有什么？a. 杂货店b. 自助洗衣店c. 电影院d. 邮局1. aReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
