You must go to your grandfather’s house to eat.” I wanted to tell my mother that I had never been to my grandfather’s house alone. However, no words came out of my mouth and my mother scurried away without a trace. Therefore, I could only brace myself and go through the dark streets to my grandfather’s house.I was scared, so I walked very fast and didn’t say hello when I saw my neighbor. I didn’t relax until I saw my grandfather.1 – 他得去哪里？a. 妈妈家b. 爸爸家c. 爷爷家d. 奶奶家2 – 他见到邻居的时候做了什么？a. 继续走b. 跟邻居聊天c. 感到更害怕d. 惊叫1. c2. aReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
