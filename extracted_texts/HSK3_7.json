    "text": "China is a big country so it naturally has large variance in food available.This intermediate article takes a look at some of the staples foods in both North and South China.因为中国很大，天气不同，所以生活在中国不同地方的人吃的食物也非常的不一样。在中国北方，以面条和馒头为主，因为中国北方种的粮食是小麦；在中国南方，以米饭为主，因为中国南方种的粮食是水稻。Because China is large and the weather is different, people living in different parts of China eat very different foods.In northern China, noodles and steamed bread are the mainstay, because Northern China plants lots of wheat. In Southern China, rice is the main source of food, because they grow a lot of rice.1 – 中国北方主要吃什么？a. 馒头b. 米饭c. 馒头和米饭d. 馒头和面条2 – 中国南方主要吃什么？a. 馒头b. 米饭c. 馒头和米饭d. 馒头和面条1. d2. bReview frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
