People not just in China but all over the world are encouraged to plant trees!Different countries have different days for this festival, in China it is on the 12th of March.每年的3月12日是植树节。这一天小区的工作人员号召我们在小区里植树。早晨，我很兴奋的起床，早早的来到小区的花园里。爸爸帮我扶着一棵小树苗，我用尽全身的力气把土盖在树苗的根上，然后妈妈在旁边帮我浇水。之后我在这棵小树苗上拴上了一条绳子，用来标记这是我种的树。希望有一天这颗小树苗能够长成参天大树，希望我们的环境能够变得越来越好！今天真是开心的一天。Every March 12th is “Tree Planting Day”. On this day, the community workers call us to plant trees in the community.In the morning, I excitedly get up and go to the garden of the community early. Dad helps me with a small sapling. I use all my strength to cover the roots of the sapling with soil, and then my mother helps me to water it. Then I put a rope on the sapling to mark it as a tree that I planted.I hope that one day this small sapling will grow into a towering tree, I hope our environment can get better and better!
