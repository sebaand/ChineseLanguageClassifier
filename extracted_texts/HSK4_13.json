    "text": "This Mandarin dialogue is about asking for directions.彼得：小王，公司经理让我下午去总公司开会。但是，我刚来不久，还不清楚总公司位置在哪里。你能帮我下吗？小王：好，没问题。总公司在黄庄。你可以坐地铁10号线过去，在黄庄站下车。或者打车过去，但是钱会多。彼得：坐地铁过去吗？那怎么买地铁票呢？小王：很简单的。到了地铁站以后，你可以直接去找工作人员，在人工窗口买票。也可以在售票机器处买一张地铁卡。也可以在机器处按照指示选择地铁线路和地点。在中国生活，尤其是在北京，是很方便的。地铁售票机器上都有英文提示的，完全可以看懂。彼得：太好了，我好爱中国！我要慢慢学习中文了。Peter：Xiao Wang, the company manager asked me to go to the head office in the afternoon. However, I have not been here long and I am not clear on where the head office is located. Can you help me?小王：Ok, no problem. The head office is in Haidian. You can take Metro Line 10 and get off at Huangzhuang Station. Or take a taxi, but that will cost more money.Peter：Take the subway? How do you buy a subway ticket?小王：Very simple. After arriving at the subway station, you can go directly to the staff and buy tickets at the service window. You can also buy a subway card at the ticket machine. You can select the subway line and location at the machine as directed. Living in China, especially in Beijing, is very convenient. There are English signs on the subway ticket machine, you can understand it.Peter：Great, I love China very much! I will slowly learn more Chinese.1 – 地铁卡是用来做什么的？2 – 彼得以后会学习中文吗？Review frequently.Share with others.Return as often as you can.",
