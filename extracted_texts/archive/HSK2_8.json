    "text": "Tests (考试) are a big part of school life in China.Although Mandarin Chinese passage below says that coffee (咖啡) is a good way to wake up for exams; you probably shouldn’t do it.昨天晚上我很晚才睡，因为今天早上我要考试，但是还没有复习，所以学习到很晚。考试开始，我就不累了。我很快地完成了试卷，然后就回家睡觉了。I slept very late last night because I will take an exam in the morning but I hadn’t revised yet so I stay up late studying.Before I went to the exam in the morning, I felt very tired and drank a cup of coffee.When the exam started, I didn’t feel tired. I finished the test paper very quickly and went home to sleep.",
