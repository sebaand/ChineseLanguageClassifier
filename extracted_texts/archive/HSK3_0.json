It continues at a HSK 3 level.小明：你想去哪个公园？在学校西边的公园可以游泳，但不可以钓鱼；学校东边的公园可以看猴子和爬山，你想去哪个？小明：Which park do you want to go to? We can swim at the park west of our school but we can’t go fishing there. At the park to the east of the school we can see monkeys and do some climbing. Which one do you want to go to?小红：I want to go and see monkeys!小明：Then let’s go to the eastern park.",
