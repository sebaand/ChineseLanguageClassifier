    "text": "Learn meteorological and geographical terminology in this reading article.地球被划分成了南北半球，所以在气温、气候和植被方面有很大差距。最明显的一个区别是，南北半球的温差，以中国和澳大利亚为例，中国是夏天的时候，澳大利亚是冬天，炎热的三十摄氏度和凉爽的十摄氏度。从海陆位置来说，沿海地区温度要凉爽一些，因为靠近大海空气流动，降水也多。但是内陆地区降水比较少。地形因素，是因为通常情况下，迎风坡降水要比背风坡降水多，温度自然要高。The earth is divided into the northern and southern hemispheres and there is a big gap in temperature, climate and vegetation. The most obvious difference is the temperature difference between the northern and southern hemispheres. For example, China and Australia, when it is summer in China the temperature is about 30 degrees celsius. At the same time, it is winter is Australia with lows of 10 degrees Celsius.Factors affecting the weather in various places include latitude, sea position, and terrain.Looking at latitude, the temperature near the equator is high, and there is a lot of rain.From land and sea locations, the temperature in the coastal area is cooler, because the air flows more near the sea and there is more precipitation. However, precipitation in inland areas is relatively small.The topographical factor is because, in general, the windward slope is more precipitative than the leeward slope, and the temperature is naturally higher.Because of these factors, temperatures around the world are different.",
