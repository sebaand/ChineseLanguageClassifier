    "text": "A Chinese reading passage talking about healthy and unhealthy foods.健康对任何人来说都是很重要的，尤其是孩子和老年人。因此，在选择食物的时候，人们会区分什么样的食物是健康的，什么样的食物是不健康的。在一般人看来，水果和新鲜的蔬菜对身体是有帮助的。但是在快餐店里卖的食物，比如，汉堡，薯条，大家认为是不健康的。所以要少吃。可是，在现代人的生活中，不健康的食物又随处可见，能够比较方便的购买到。尤其是上班族，他们没有时间自己做饭，只能去快餐店里购买食物。Being healthy is important for all people, especially children and seniors. For this reason, when choosing food to eat, people will differentiate which types of food are healthy and which types are unhealthy.For ordinary people, fruit and fresh vegetables are helpful but the food you can purchase in Fast Food restaurants, such as burgers and french fries, everyone recognises them to be unhealthy and should eat less of them.However, in the life of modern people, unhealthy food can be seen everywhere. It is more convenient to buy. Especially when people have finished working, they don’t have time to cook for themselves.
