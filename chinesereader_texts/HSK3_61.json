    "translation": "Little bear lived in a mountain cave. Grandfather bear said to Little Bear: “Go and build a wooden house to live in!”\nIn spring, little bear went into the forest. The trees were full of green leaves, and he couldn’t bear to cut them down.\nIn summer, little bear again went into the forest. The trees were full of fresh flowers, and he couldn’t bear to cut them down.\nIn autumn, little bear went into the forest. The trees were full of hanging fruit, and he couldn’t bear to cut them down.\nIn winter, little bear went into the forest. Many little birds were living in the trees, and he couldn’t bear to cut them down.\nYears passed, and little bear still hadn’t made a home out of the trees. He was still living happily in his mountain cave.\nThe little forest animals thanked Little Bear very much, and they gave him a bunch of beautiful fresh flowers.",
