    "translation": "By the sea, a man came across a sailor who had just returned from the ocean. They started to chat. The man asked the sailor: “Do you like the sea?” \n“Of course.” The sailor answered: “And my family is just like me, they all love the sea.” \n“Where’s your father now?”\n“He died in the ocean.” \n“Your grandfather?”\n“He died in the Western Seas.” \n“Your brother…”\n“He was lost during a big storm, at that time he was catching fish in the Indian Ocean.”\n“In that case,” the man said, “if I were you, I would certainly never go to sea.”\n“Are you willing to tell me where your father died?” the sailor asked the man. \n“Oh, he stopped breathing in bed.” \n“And your grandfather?” \n“He also died in bed.”\n“In that case,” the sailor said, “if I were you, I’d would never go to bed.”",
