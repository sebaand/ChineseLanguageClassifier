    "text": "帮忙爸爸出差，可早晨起得迟了。他忙洗脸刷牙，姐姐帮爸爸整理衣服，妈妈给他端早餐，帮他找笔记本。爸爸一边吃早餐，一边摸口袋，咦，火车票哪去了？爸爸放下牛奶、蛋糕，手忙脚乱地找车票。小弟弟多么想帮爸爸做点儿事啊，可他什么也帮不上。小弟弟想：“帮爸爸吃早餐吧。”他爬上凳子，将爸爸吃剩的牛奶、蛋糕全吃了。",
    "translation": "Father was going out of town for work, but in the morning he woke up late. He got busy washing his face and brushing his teeth, and elder sister helped him pack his clothes, mother brought him breakfast, and helped him find his notebook. While father ate his breakfast, he felt his pockets, Ack!, where did the train ticket go? Father put down the milk, the cake, and scrambled around looking for the ticket. Little brother so wanted to help father do something, but there was nothing he could do to help. Little brother thought: “How about I help dad eat breakfast.” He climbed up on the stool, took the leftover milk and cake and ate it all up.",
