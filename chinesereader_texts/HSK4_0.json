    "text": "《和尚背女人》从前，有一大一小两个和尚出门化缘，起到一条河边时，看见一个妙龄女子被水围困着不能过河，于是大和尚毫不犹豫地将她背起过了河。小和尚大为不解，晚上便忍不住问道：“师兄，出家人六根清净，你背了那女人，不是犯了戒吗?”大和尚答道：“我背那女子一过河就放下了，可师弟你，为什么到现在还背着她放不下来?”",
    "translation": "Long ago, there was one elder and one younger monk who went out to beg for alms, when they reached the riverbank, they saw a fair young lady who was surrounded by water and couldn’t cross the river. So without the slightest hesitation the elder monk carried her across the river on his back. The younger monk didn’t understand at all, and that night couldn’t help but ask:\n“Older brother, those who take the robes follow the Six Precepts of purity and cleanliness, you carried that woman on your back, is that not a violation of the commandments?”\nThe elder monk replied: “I carried that woman and put her down as soon as I crossed the river. But Little Brother, how is it that you are still carrying her and have not yet put her down?”",
