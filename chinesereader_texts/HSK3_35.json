    "translation": "In the last few days, I did a not-so-illustrious thing, and I’m ashamed to say it. In the evening, I went to JiangDong Park to play, and I saw that there were a few other children catching frogs, so I also hurriedly started catching frogs, and after I caught them I brought them back to my house. At my house I took care of them for a few days, but the frogs gradually became thinner and thinner, it’s like they were saying to me: “Put us back in nature, and we can catch more insects.” I listened to this and was truly embarrassed0 so that night, I secretly put them back outside.",
